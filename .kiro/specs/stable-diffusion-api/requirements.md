# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a containerized stable diffusion API service that runs on Debian with GeForce GTX 1060 6GB GPU support. The API allows users to generate images from text descriptions with configurable parameters including generation steps and image dimensions. The service uses a lightweight stable diffusion model optimized for the GTX 1060's 6GB VRAM capacity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a client application developer, I want to send image generation requests to a REST API, so that I can integrate AI image generation into my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is sent to the API endpoint THEN the system SHALL accept JSON payload with description, steps, and dimensions
2. WHEN the request is valid THEN the system SHALL return a generated image in a standard format
3. WHEN the request is invalid THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP error codes with descriptive messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to specify the number of generation steps, so that I can control the quality and generation time of my images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN steps parameter is provided THEN the system SHALL use that value for diffusion steps
2. WHEN steps parameter is between 1 and 50 THEN the system SHALL process the request
3. WHEN steps parameter is outside valid range THEN the system SHALL return a validation error
4. WHEN steps parameter is not provided THEN the system SHALL use a default value of 20 steps

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to specify image dimensions, so that I can generate images in the size I need for my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN width and height parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL generate an image with those dimensions
2. WHEN dimensions are multiples of 64 and between 256x256 and 768x768 THEN the system SHALL process the request
3. WHEN dimensions are invalid THEN the system SHALL return a validation error with supported dimension ranges
4. WHEN dimensions are not provided THEN the system SHALL use default dimensions of 512x512

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the service to run in a Docker container, so that I can easily deploy and manage the application across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the container is started THEN the system SHALL initialize the stable diffusion model
2. WHEN the container has access to NVIDIA GPU THEN the system SHALL utilize GPU acceleration
3. WHEN the container starts THEN the system SHALL expose the API on a configurable port
4. WHEN the container is stopped THEN the system SHALL gracefully shutdown and cleanup resources

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the service optimized for GTX 1060 6GB, so that it runs efficiently within the GPU's memory constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the model loads THEN the system SHALL use no more than 5GB of VRAM
2. WHEN generating images THEN the system SHALL complete generation without out-of-memory errors
3. WHEN multiple requests are processed THEN the system SHALL manage memory efficiently to prevent crashes
4. WHEN the service starts THEN the system SHALL use a lightweight stable diffusion model variant

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a client, I want to receive generated images in a standard format, so that I can easily integrate them into my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN image generation completes THEN the system SHALL return the image as base64 encoded data
2. WHEN image generation completes THEN the system SHALL include metadata about generation parameters
3. WHEN image generation fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages
4. WHEN the response is sent THEN the system SHALL include proper HTTP headers for image content

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to optionally specify a seed value for image generation, so that I can reproduce specific images or get random results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a seed parameter is provided THEN the system SHALL use that seed for deterministic generation
2. WHEN seed parameter is a valid integer THEN the system SHALL process the request with that seed
3. WHEN seed parameter is not provided THEN the system SHALL generate a random seed for each request
4. WHEN the same seed and parameters are used THEN the system SHALL generate identical images

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling, so that I can debug issues and provide good user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GPU is not available THEN the system SHALL log appropriate warnings and fall back to CPU if possible
2. WHEN model loading fails THEN the system SHALL return startup errors with diagnostic information
3. WHEN generation takes too long THEN the system SHALL implement reasonable timeouts
4. WHEN system resources are exhausted THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP 503 status codes
